Short text of what the idea for the skill are or would be:
My Idea where to give Survivors a little chanse in having a small procetion, won't do much but better than nothing.

Skill Name:Vital Mutation
Skill Desctiption or Info:Being in the wasteland alot has had a few side effects (+1 HP Per 20 Sec)
Skill type: on spawn
Skill Job: Jobs in rp that have been in the wasteland alot (Eg Stalkers)
Skill Effect Good/Bad sides:+Regeneration -Slow -Bleeding still Applies
Short text of what the idea for the skill are or would be:An Apocolypse RP wouldnt be right without mutation right? This is 
good for when Medics arn't available and the Player is in dire need of healing, but this does not affect bleeding and
medics will still be VERY vital
